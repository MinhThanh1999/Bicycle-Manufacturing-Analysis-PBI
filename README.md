# Bicycle-Manufacturing-Analysis-PBI

## Introduction
- Get the AdventureWorks2019 dataset from Google BigQuery, then import it to Power BI.
- Use Power Query to clean and transform the data for ready-to-use.
- Apply Design Thinking to visualize insights for readers such as stakeholders, managers, and leaders.
- In this dataset, we have a lot of data from various departments. I chose data from the manufacturing and product departments to analyze.

### Overall Insights:
- The production process is efficient with a high yield and low scrap rate.
- There is potential to increase production capacity as current utilization is less than half.
- The average cycle time has improved over time and remains consistent despite fluctuations in order quantities.
- Monitoring and optimizing capacity utilization could further enhance production efficiency and output.

### Overall Insights:
- The location names are based on their functions.
- The inventory levels are generally high, with a significant amount of safety stock, which suggests a conservative approach to inventory management.
- The presence of products out of stock and a substantial number of products under reorder indicates areas for improvement in inventory forecasting and supply chain coordination.
- The distribution of stock across locations shows where the majority of inventory is held, with subassembly having the largest share, which might be due to its role in the production process.
- Monitoring and adjusting reorder points, stock levels, and safety stock can help optimize inventory management, reduce costs, and improve service levels.

### Overall Insights:
- Primary Causes of Scrap: The leading causes of scrap are related to the paint process and incorrect trim lengths, indicating potential areas for process improvement.
- Process and Quality Control: Many of the scrap reasons, such as incorrect drill size, misaligned wheels, and failed primer processes, suggest issues with precision and quality control in manufacturing.
- Trend Analysis: The scrap trend over the years shows that there were significant increases and decreases, suggesting varying levels of efficiency or different challenges faced over time.
- Cost Impact: The high cost associated with scrap emphasizes the need to address the primary causes of scrap to reduce waste and improve overall profitability.
- Focus Areas for Improvement: Addressing the top scrap reasons (paint process, trim length, and thermoform temperature) could lead to significant reductions in scrap and associated costs.
- By targeting the main causes of scrap and implementing stricter quality control measures, the company can reduce waste, improve efficiency, and lower production costs.
